# Why do we need version control for the Montana Mesonet?

## [Stations](https://github.com/mt-climate-office/mesonet-ln-programs)
  - Track what code is deployed to what station
  - Track when code changes on the stations
  - Easily integrate changes that are deployable across stations
  - Roll back detrimental changes to well-known version
  - Systematic testing with bench unit(s)
  - Consistency, Reliability, Trust

**Question: How do we define a canonical program, and how do we handle versioning?**
**Question: How do we track station configuration/settings changes, outside of the program?**

## [Loggernet Server](https://github.com/mt-climate-office/mesonet-ln-server)
  - Track changes (equipment additions)
  - Ease troubleshooting
  - Enable rapid deployment to new compute infrastracture, if necessary
